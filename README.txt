We're pleased to have completed the challenge for the International Bioinformatics Programming Competition (IBPC) 2016.

We hope our solver modelling cell division will be useful to the scientific community.

The solver is implemented in an assembly-like language, affectionately named "rust" after what its compiler does to your brain. To observe it in action obtain a stable version from your local rust dealership and run the following:

$ cargo drawproblem 16

We cleverly hid the solver behind this command to avoid infringing on any Solve related trademarks. But don't be confused, it doesn't draw anything to your screen! It will however create an SVG file within the icfp2016problems directory for later viewing at your leisure.
